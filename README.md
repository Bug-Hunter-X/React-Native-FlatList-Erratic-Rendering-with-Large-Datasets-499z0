# React Native FlatList Rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a common, yet difficult-to-diagnose bug in React Native's `FlatList` component when dealing with large datasets and complex item renderers.  The issue manifests as inconsistent rendering behavior, with items randomly appearing, disappearing, or failing to update correctly. 

The bug is exacerbated by inefficient `keyExtractor` implementations or performance bottlenecks within the item rendering logic.

## Problem Description

The `FlatList` component, while highly performant, can exhibit erratic behavior when presented with a significant volume of data and complex item components.  This instability leads to a suboptimal user experience and presents significant debugging challenges due to its inconsistent nature.

## Solution

The solution involves addressing performance bottlenecks and ensuring a robust `keyExtractor` implementation.  Optimizing the `renderItem` function and using a unique, stable key for each item is crucial.  Consider memoization techniques to further enhance performance.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app (e.g., `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`).
4. Observe the erratic rendering behavior of the `FlatList` component.
