This React Native bug arises when using the `FlatList` component with a large dataset and complex item renderers.  The issue manifests as erratic rendering behavior, with items appearing and disappearing unexpectedly, or failing to update properly when data changes.  This often occurs when the `keyExtractor` function isn't correctly implemented or when there are performance bottlenecks in the item rendering process itself. The bug is difficult to debug because it's inconsistent and doesn't always produce the same symptoms.

```javascript
// buggy component
<FlatList
  data={largeDataset}
  renderItem={({item}) => (
    <ComplexItemComponent item={item} />
  )}
  keyExtractor={(item, index) => index} // Problematic keyExtractor
/>
```
